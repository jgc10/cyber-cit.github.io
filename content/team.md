The cyber@CIT hacking team competes in both red and blue team competitions that provide students with hands-on experience in real-world cyber operations. Students interested in competing with the team should regularly attend the club meetings or contact the club president for guidance on how to practice for the competition they are interested in. Joining the team is highly recommended, as competiting is the most effective (and fun) method for improving your cybersecurity skills and obtaining experience sought after for internships, jobs, and scholarships.

The University of New Haven is also the host of the CPTC New England Regional.
